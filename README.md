This is a tool that I made that can be helpful when analysing and researching US government debt

What this tool does:
  + Constructs the yield curve on two different dates based on data from FRED, which can then be saved as a csv
  + Plots the yield curves of different securities and the yield spread between them. This data can also be saved as a csv.
  + Contains a news tab, allowing users to find relevant news
  + Displays a sidebard containing the most recent US macroeconomic data
